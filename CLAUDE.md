- If not set, use `source setup.sh` to set up the environment.
- When staging and committing:
  - Follow the rule in ./docs/developer/github.md.
  - This rule also applies to pull requests.
  - Claude Code, DO NOT claim your co-authorship in the commit message.
- When it comes testing, do `pytest -n 8 -x python/ci-tests` to speedup and stop at first failure.
- `pylint` is for `python/assassyn` only, and the rc file is `python/assassyn/.pylintrc`.
  - If some refactoring is made, first run `python/ci-tests/test_driver.py` as a sanity check.
- When it comes to "based on my modifications to something.md", use `git diff`
  to read the deltas.
- When a task is finished, stage and commit the changes!
   - If pre-commit on pytest phase fails after three attempts, stop and report!
   - You **CANNOT** you `--no-verify` to bypass pre-commit! Otherwise, your mother will explode!
