# Module Generation

This module generates the simulation of each Assassyn [module](../../ir/module/),
including [pipeline stage](../../ir/module/module.py) and [downstream](../../ir/module/downstream.py).

## Exposed Interface

```python
def dump_modules(sys: SysBuilder, fd):
```

This function iterates over all the modules within the `sys`tem
to the given `fd`.

> TODO: All the memory related callbacks are currently a bad hack. Later implement them in a fundamental way.

This function instantiates `ElaborateModule`, which provides the key methods of dumping each module.

## Generated Module

### DRAM Module

DRAM module is special because `Ramulator2` adopts a callback-based response interface.
The callback function should have the signature like below:

```rust
extern "C" fn callback_of_<dram>(req: *mut Request, sim: *mut c_void);
```

`req` is the response's corresponding request, and `sim` is the `Simulator` pointer.
In this unsafe function, it:
1. Cast `sim` to `Simulator` in simulator.rs generated by [simulator.py](./simulator.py).
2. As explained in [simulator.md](./simulator.md), it sets the `sim.<dram>_resp.valid` to `true`.
3. If it is a write, commit the value to the corresponding payload array.
   - This array can be found by the `sim.<dram>._payload`
   - As Ramulator2 does not maintain data themselves, the data can be found by
     `sim.<dram>_resp.get((sim.time_stamp, addr))`
4. If it is a read, write the value to `sim.<dram>_resp.data`, and address to `sim.<dram>_resp.addr`.



### Pipeline Stage & Downstream

Each generated module looks like below, which returns if this module is properly executed.
If the module successfully hits the end of the module, it returns `true`.
When it comes to a `wait_until` intrinsic, and the condition is not true,
it returns `false`.

This function will be exposed in `super::modules::*` and
invoked by `simulate_<module-name>` generated by [simulator.py](./simulator.py).

```rust
pub fn <module-name>(sim: &mut Simulator) -> bool {
```

Then it traverses all the components of within the module to dump the code accordingly
using the [visitor pattern](../../ir/visitor.py).


### Block

Block generation is done by `visit_block` of the visitor pattern.
- Conditional block is an if-statement.
- Cycled block is an `if sim.stamp / 100 == cycle`, as [simulator](./simulator.md)
  adopts a fixed point number for time stamp.

### Expression

Expression generation is done by `visit_expr` in visitor pattern.
The expression dumping are first dispatched to implementations in [_expr](./_expr/),
and then after dumping the expression itself, it also generates
the expression exposure --- if this expression is used by
an external module, write it to the `sim` context by generating

```rust
sim.<expr>_value = Some(value);
```

### IntImm

It provides helper function to generate the leaf node, immediate constants
in `visit_intimm`.
